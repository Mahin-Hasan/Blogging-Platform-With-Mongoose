# Blogging Platform Backend

A robust backend solution for a blogging platform, enabling secure user authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations for blogs. This API is built with modern web technologies, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.

## üöÄ Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admins can manage users and blogs, while users can manage their own blogs.
- **Secure Authentication**: Includes hashed passwords, JWT-based authentication, and session management.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve blogs with full user ownership control.
- **Public API**: Provides endpoints for public blog browsing with advanced search, sort, and filter functionalities.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Consistent and detailed error response structure for easier debugging.
- **Middleware**: Pre-save middleware for data validation and role verification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for scalable data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for schema-based data modeling.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- **JWT**: Secure token-based user authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: Hashing library for secure password storage.
